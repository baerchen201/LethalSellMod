## Usage:

 - /sell [value]
 - /sell { quota | all }

### Selling a specific value

Typing `/sell 100` in the game chat will put exactly 100 on the sell desk (calculated with sell percentage), or if no exact value match is found, slightly more.

If you can't afford that amount, nothing will be sold.

**You need to sell the items manually, this command only puts them on the desk.** This can be done using `/sell` (with no arguments) or by making noise near the sell desk.

### Selling quota

`/sell quota` will sell the closest amount to your current quota.

### Selling everything

`/sell all` will sell all items.
